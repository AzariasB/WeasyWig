            Here's the official documentation of the Weasywig editor. You have to read it carefully if you want to developp your own modules for this
            editor. The documentation is diveded into differents parts, each corresponding to an aspect of the editor.
            If you create your own module or change a library or add a custom block, I strongly recommand to add what you did in the documentation,
            so that the next users can work with what you did.<br/>
            This documentation is made for the developper who wants to improve the editor. Is you're a simple user who wants to know how to create
            a page with the editor, you can go an the 'help' section of the editor.<br/>
            In this part of the documentation, we'll talk about the global working of the editor. So that you understand how the core is working.
            And if needed, you will be able to improve it.<br/>
            Good reading !

        <h3 id="architecture" >Architecture</h3>
        <p>
            The editor have an MVC architectural pattern. MVC stands for Model-view-controller.
            The model is the data-storage part.
            The view correspond to the display and the users interaction.
            And the controller is working with both the model and the view to display the good informations and modify it when needed.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-group list-unstyled" >
            <li class="list-group-item" >
                <h5>The controller</h5>
                <p>
                    There is a main controller for the editor. This controller is called 'Weasywig', you'll find the main function of the editor on it
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item" >
                <h5>The View</h5>
                <p>
                    There is a view. The view is simply called 'view.js'. In the view, there are all the events listeners and the function to interact with the DOM object
                    If you want to show a modal, hide a div or interact with the DOM, you have to pass by the view. Either you can add a function
                    in the views prototype or you can call a function that return a DOM object and then interact with this object.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item" >
                <h5>The Model</h5>
                <p>
                    There is not a unique model object. The model is composed with the differents '.js' files containing informations for the controller
                    Then, this data is giver to the controller, who can manipulate it, and/or give access to the view.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Here's a sketch to help you undrestand how the editor architectural pattern is working.

        <h3 id="librairies" >Librairies</h3>
        <p>
            To help you improve the editor, some librarires are at your disposal.
            The main library is the <a href="#doc_em">easyModal</a> one.
            Others are not really librairies, it's more plugins. Like the <a href="#doc_ctx">contextmenu</a>
            and the <a href="#doc_states">states manager</a> ones.<br/>
            The easyModal library is a set of function to easyly create usefull modals.<br/>
            The contextmenu plugin, is to customize the contextmenu wich is displayed when the user righ-cick
            on an element on the editor<br/>
            The states manager plugin let you create accessible states to navigate to when you're editing your page.

        <h3 id="dependencies" >Dependencies</h3>
        <p>
            The project require some basics css and js librairies.
            Of course, these libraires allready are in the project.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-group list-unstyled" >
            <li class="list-group-item" >
                First of all, and the main dependency is the <a title="jQuery" href="https://jquery.com/" target='_blank'>jQuery</a>
                library. <strong>The minimum version must be 1.9</strong>
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                To create some nice visual features, <a title="jQuery UI" href="https://jqueryui.com/" target="_blank" >jQuery UI</a>
                is a very usefull js/css library which is used in this project.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group list-group-item" >
                Then to have a good css base, the well-known css framework <a title="Bootstrap official website" href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" >bootstrap</a>
                is necessary. <strong>The minimum used version must be 3.0</strong>
            </li>
            <li class="list-group list-group-item" >
                To be able to do basic data-processing, the editor is using <a title="Underscorejs.org" href="http://underscorejs.org/" target="_blank">underscore.js</a>
                this library offers a lot of usefull functions, and the documentation is really well-made.
                You can check the existing function if you need some of thems during the creation of modules
            </li>
            <li class="list-group list-group-item" > 
                You've certainly saw that it's possible to use keyboard shorcuts in the editor.
                The handle of these shortcuts is made thanks to  <a title="Mousetrap webiste"  href="https://craig.is/killing/mice" target="_blank">mousetrap</a>
                this is a great library to handle keyboard inputs.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
           Make sure to have all those library if the project is not working.
           If you're sure you've got them all, be carefull about the versions you're using.
           And if its still not working, even if you have the good versions, please contact us (see homepage)
