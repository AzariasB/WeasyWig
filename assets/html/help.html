            <h3>General informations</h3>
            <p>This editor is a Wysiwyg editor. Wysiwyg stands for <em>What You See is What You Get</em>
                There are several ways to use Wysiwyg. One way is to drag'n'drop the elements in divs.
                We decided that it would be more secure and easier to have a visual of where you can add your content.
                The places where you can add what you want have a big 'plus' in the middle. And when you hover your mouse on these
                sections, the cross will animate. Now if you click on this div, a sideBar will open to propose you the things
                you can add it this div. The possible choices are separate into three parts : the basic css components (text,heading),
                the more complex components, and finally, the javascrip-requiring components. Of course you don't need to have any knowledge
                in code. It's just a way to organise the features. If you're getting lost in all these, you can search the feature you want.
                If the feature you're looking for exists, the accordion will unfold, and the feature you're looking for will look <span class="found" >like this</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Nobody's perfect, so if you missclick on a bad div and you didn't want that to happen, you can click on 'nevermind'
                and it will cancel the adding action.
            </p>

            <h3>Shortctus</h3>
            <p>To save your times, we set some shortcuts so that you just have to do a combination of keys on you keyboard.
                The major part of the existing shortcuts are indicated with a little tag <span class="label label-info" >Like this</span>
                Here is the list all of the available shortcuts :
            <ul class="list-group list-unstyled" >
                <li class="list-group-item" >
                    <h4>Ctrl + s</h4>

                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item" >
                    <h4>Ctrl + z</h4>
                    <p>To undo the last action you did (see description down below)</p>
                </li>

                    <h4>Ctrl + left</h4>
                    <p>Go to the previous view (see decription down below)</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item" >
                    <h4>Ctrl + r</h4>
                    <p>Restart you project (see description down below)</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item" >
                    <h4>Ctrl + h</h4>
                    <p>Go on the home page (see description down below)</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Options</h3>
            <ul class="list-group list-unstyled" >
                <li class="list-group-item" >
                    <h4>Save</h4>
                    <p>Create a project is a good thing. But if you can save it, it's even better. So by clicking this button,
                        you can save your project, leave your work, close the tab. And then when you come back, the project will
                        be proposed in the main page. If you didt' give any name to your project yet, one name will be asked to you.
                    <p class="text-danger" >Attention, if you give a name to your project, and this project name already exists,
                        the existing one will be replaced by the new one.
                    </p>
                    So you can create multiple projects and name them differently.
                    <!--Todo : can delete the save --> 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item" >
                    <h4>Undo</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you missclick and place a new element at a bad place, you can cancel your action. By clicking on this
                        button, or by doing the shortcut : <kbd>ctrl + z</kbd>. The last block you placed will be removed.
                        You can undo straight multiple actions. But if you want to restart the whole project, the best way
                        is to click on 'restart'.
                    <p class="text-warning" >
                        The undo action only work for the 'add' action, not for the actions such as 'changing font color' and those
                        proposed by the contextmenu
                    </p>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item" > 
                    <h4>Restart</h4>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes, you can just think 'well, my project is not that good, I'd better restart from the beginning'.
                        In this case, you just have to click on the 'restar' button. Be really carefull : this action is no revesrible
                        If you're not sure if you want to keep your work, it would be better to create a whole new project instead
                        of delete the current and lose all the time spent.
                    <p class="text-danger" >Once again, if you restart a project, you can't undo the restart action, be really carefull</p>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item" >
                    <h4>Documentation</h4>
                    <p>
                        This part is mostyl for the developpers who want to develop plugins for the weasywig editor.
                        The documentation is composed of the differents API of the Weasywigs components.
                        If you're not a developper, you'll get lost, but it can helps you understanding the all working of 
                        the editor.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item" >
                    <h4>Home</h4>
                    <p>
                        We don't want you to get stuck on the editor, so you can go back on the main page.
                        Just click this button and go back to the menu
                    <p class="text-warning" >If you don't save your project when leaving, it will not save automatically.
                        So don't forget to save before leaving.
                    </p>
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Contextmenu options</h3>
            You can access to these options at every moment, just by righ-clicking on a created div.
            The contextmenu will only appear if you clicked on a created div. It won't work on the available boxes.
            (the ones with the '+' in it)
            <ul class="list-group list-unstyled" >
                <li class="list-group-item" >
                    <h4>Change font color</h4>
                    <p>
                        To add some colors to your creation, you can change the fonts color of the selected div.
                        You can enter differents values for color :
                    <ul class="list-unstyled list-group" >
                        <li class="list-group-item" >An hexadecimal value (looking like this : <kbd>#123123</kbd> ) </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item" >A red-green-blue value. Someting like this :<kbd>rgb(1,2,3)</kbd> </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item" >An existing color in html colors : <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colorsfull.asp">existing values</a> </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item" >
                    <h4>Change background color</h4>
                    <p>
                        Because changing the font color is not enougth, you can also change the background-color of a div.
                        The possibles colors are the same as the font color.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item" >
                    <h4>Change font size</h4>
                    <p>
                        The default font-size might be to small for you (or too big ?). So you can change it in two clicks
                        If you enter a simple number, the default unit will be the pixels, but you can change this just by
                        adding the good unit of mesure right beind the value. Like this <kbd>1.3em</kbd>
                        If you give a unit it must be a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp" target="_blanck" >css-valid unit</a>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item" >
                    <h4>Remove</h4>
                    <p>If you want to remove a part of your page, you can, just by choosing this option</p>
                    <p class="text-warning" >The remove action cannot be cancelled</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Differents Views and modes</h3>
            You can go from a view to another by choosing it on the right dropdown of the navbar.
            An other way to change is simply to do the sorctus <kbd> <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd> left</kbd>  </kbd> or
            <kbd><kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>rigt</kbd> </kbd>. A piece of take !
            You can change of view as many times as you want.
            <ul class="list-group list-unstyled" >
                <li class="list-group-item" >
                    <h4>Editor</h4>
                    <p>
                        The main part of the editor : the editor itself.
                        Where you can change remove, add blocks to your page.
                        It is the default page of the editor.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item" >
                    <h4>View result</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you want to have a preview of what your page is giving without all the available divs.
                        Thanks to this view, you can clearly see how your page look, and if it actually look as you expected.
                        If it does no suits to you, you can come back to the editor and change what you have to change.

                    <h4>Edit code</h4>
                    <p>
                        You can see the HTML code generated by the editor. You can either copy-paste it or edit it.
                        We're sorry for the bad display. Weasywig did not succeed to display it as well as it should be
                        and because of that, it's really hard to edit the code directly in the app. We recommand to copy-paste
                        it into your favorite editor, modify it, and then paste the new code into the editable div.
                        As soon as you come back to the editor, the displayed content correspond to the code wich was in the div.
                    </p>
